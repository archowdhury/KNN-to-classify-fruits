# KNN-to-classify-fruits
In this mini-project we will compare the results using KNN classification directly versus using the Caret package

For K-Nearest Neighbours classification pre-processing the data is very important. The data needs to be scaled and centered.

Using the native KNN algorithm we got an accuracy of 80%. When we used the Caret package to pre-Process the data and do cross-validation the accuracy drastically increased to 93%!!
